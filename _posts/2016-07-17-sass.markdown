Uh Yeah! I got a hardwired hyperlink into the footer-generator of jekyll. No big deal … but Yeah! I am beginning to understand the workings of jekyll.

I am looking forward to learning sass for swagging my microsite really into deep space.
Well, actually I started messing around with sass already. It’s ultra intuitive to me. I just redesigned my jekyll blog. This one here. Now it definitely looks bold!
