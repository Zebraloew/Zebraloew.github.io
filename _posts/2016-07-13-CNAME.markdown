Codecademy is going down a narrow path, which is often hard to adapt to similar scenarios.
I tried to setup a nice domain-name for my new jekyll blog hosted on github, but it just didn’t work out. 
To be fair, I tried something quite different then the course suggested.

I have my jakobmalek.com domain. And I want the jekyll.jakobmalek.com to point to the github page. So I set up a CNAME file in the jekyll directory. Changed the Github settings. Now it got complitcated with those Name Servers. I found the option for them at the menues at my providers Interface. But I just don’t know how to get it right. 

Maybe I’ll figure it out at some point, but for today I am going to focus on bringing the first Portfolio Part to my own webspace.
