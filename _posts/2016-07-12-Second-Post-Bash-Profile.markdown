My first Bash Profile File.
So proud.

{% highlight ruby %}
echo "Welcome, James"
export USER="James"
export PS1="----"

alias bashprofile="nano $HOME/.bash_profile"
alias bashsource="source $HOME/.bash_profile"
alias playground="cd Drive/Temporary/Command"

alias ll="ls -la"

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.9.1/gems/jekyll-2.5.2/bin

{% endhighlight %}

Codecademy is great, but combining it with Anki they grow to a profound toolset for learning web development. It is so fun learning it this way. You really should try it.
