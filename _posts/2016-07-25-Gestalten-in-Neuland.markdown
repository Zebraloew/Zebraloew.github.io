I found a bloody brilliant claim for my Zebralöw Project :
«Gestalten in Neuland»
Neuland is quite known abroad since Merkel directed this word at the interwebs. I wonder if «Gestalten» rings any bell? Let me know, if you something!
It is correct german and semi-english at once. Both use «in», «Neuland» recently entered and «Gestalt» appears since some decades, though seldom with the visual meaning which is it’s dominant meaning in german. The english gestalt tends to refer to the Gestalt Psychology, which coined the phrase 
«The whole is more than the sum of its parts».
I actually like this meaning as well.
