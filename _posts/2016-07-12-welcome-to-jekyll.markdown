Well, this is my "Hello world" with jekyll. 
And not only that. It is my first time developing straight from the terminal.
Feels very much haxxor like. I prepared myself well for this moment.

It is quite an amazing experience.

ps.:
What Jekyll wants to say:

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
